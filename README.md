# Farkle

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to create a simulation of the [Farkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle) dice game using TypeScript, allowing players to roll dice in successive rounds with the goal of reaching a target score. 

This project serves as a platform to explore and implement various strategies for maximizing score (minimizing the number of rounds needed to reach the target) based on game conditions such as cumulative points, the number of dice to roll, and potential points.

## Installation
To get started with the Dice Game Simulator, follow these steps:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

### Single game
```bash
npm start
```

Edit the src/index.ts strategy implementation to generate different results.

### Simulating multiple games
